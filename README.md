# Sparks

Do you ever find it hard to start a conversation with someone new, or wish that you could get to know someone better but can't think what to ask? Sparks is a web-based app that randonly generates questions, and tracks which questions you've already asked.

# Future Plans

* Replace the question.json static question list with a CRUD database link so users can add, edit, and delete from the question pool. 
* Add authentication so users can have unique question pools. 
* Allow users to create "friends" to track whom they've asked which questions. 
* Un-sticky hover effects on the footer
